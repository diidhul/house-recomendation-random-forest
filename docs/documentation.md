## Documentation: Building a Content-Based Filtering Model

### Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a content-based filtering model to predict certain attributes of houses based on consumer preferences and characteristics.

### Steps Taken:

1. **Data Loading:**
   - The data was loaded from a CSV file using the Pandas library.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Renaming Columns: Certain column names were renamed for clarity.
   - Dropping Unnecessary Columns: Columns deemed unnecessary for the model were dropped.
   - Feature Selection: Relevant features including age, marital status, number of children, income per month, desired facilities, and environmental preferences were selected.

3. **Encoding Categorical Variables:**
   - Label Encoding: Categorical variables like marital status and income per month were encoded using LabelEncoder.
   - One-Hot Encoding: Desired facilities and environmental preferences were one-hot encoded to convert them into numerical features suitable for modeling.

4. **Feature Scaling:**
   - Standard Scaling: Age was scaled using StandardScaler to ensure all features are on the same scale.

5. **Train-Test Split:**
   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets with a ratio of 80:20, respectively.

6. **Model Selection and Training:**
   - Random Forest Classifier: Random Forest was chosen as the model due to its ability to handle categorical data and nonlinear relationships effectively.
   - The model was trained on the training data.

7. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Accuracy Calculation: The accuracy of the model was evaluated separately for each output (Nama Perumahan, Jenis Rumah, Tipe Rumah).
   - Confusion Matrix: Confusion matrices were generated to assess the performance of the model on each output.

8. **Model Serialization:**
   - The trained model was serialized using pickle for future use.

### Conclusion:
In conclusion, a content-based filtering model was successfully built to predict certain attributes of houses based on consumer preferences and characteristics. The model achieved satisfactory accuracy, and its performance was evaluated using confusion matrices. The serialized model is now ready for deployment and integration into applications for recommending houses to consumers based on their preferences.
